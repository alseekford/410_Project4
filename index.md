Created and implemented my own multiple boosting algorithm to combinations of different regressors on the "Concrete Compressive Strength" dataset. Additional application of LightGBM algorithm. 


## Overview

For project four, I created and applied a multiple boosting algorithm of my creation to two regression techniques, **X** and **Y**, on the Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset. The Concrete Compressive Strength Dataset is multivariate and our aim is to answer questions relevant to concrete in civil engineering. The 
concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate (Darlington, 2017). 

The input features will be 'cement', 'age', and 'superplastic' describing the cement, age - the rate of gain of strength is faster to start with and the rate gets reduced with age, and superplasticizer - used in making high-strength concrete. The target, which will be predicted, is 'strength', the median value of owener-occupied homes (in thousands of dollars).

## LightGBM

```markdown
mse_lgb = []

for i in range(5):
  kf = KFold(n_splits=10,shuffle=True,random_state=i)
  # this is the Cross-Validation Loop
  for idxtrain, idxtest in kf.split(X):
    xtrain = X[idxtrain]
    ytrain = y[idxtrain]
    ytest = y[idxtest]
    xtest = X[idxtest]
    xtrain = scale.fit_transform(xtrain)
    xtest = scale.transform(xtest)
    
    dat_train = np.concatenate([xtrain,ytrain.reshape(-1,1)],axis=1)
    dat_test = np.concatenate([xtest,ytest.reshape(-1,1)],axis=1)

    # LightGBM
    model_lgbm = lgbm
    model_lgbm.fit(xtrain, ytrain)
    yhat_lgbm = model_lgbm.predict(xtest)
    mse_lgb.append(mse(ytest, yhat_lgbm))

```
